## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Change Request Detection

The system SHALL detect change request intent via the `propose_change` MCP tool call.

#### Scenario: Claude-driven detection via tool

- **GIVEN** `changesWorkflow.enabled` is `true` AND the trigger's changes workflow is enabled
- **AND** the user has dev role (or higher)
- **WHEN** Claude determines the message is requesting code changes
- **THEN** Claude calls `propose_change` with branch, description, and repo
- **AND** the tool validates the input and returns a ref ID
- **AND** Claude includes a `change` action in `submit_response` referencing the ref

#### Scenario: Claude identifies question (no tool call)

- **GIVEN** change tools are available
- **WHEN** Claude determines the message is asking a question
- **THEN** Claude does NOT call `propose_change`
- **AND** Claude calls `submit_response` with an answer and standard Q&A actions

#### Scenario: Branch validation in tool

- **WHEN** Claude calls `propose_change` with a branch name
- **THEN** the tool validates the branch follows `clack/{type}/{name}` convention
- **AND** validates `type` is one of: fix, feat, refactor, docs, chore
- **AND** returns an error if validation fails, allowing Claude to retry

#### Scenario: Repository validation in tool

- **WHEN** Claude calls `propose_change` with a repo name
- **THEN** the tool validates the repo exists in configuration and supports changes
- **AND** returns an error with the list of available repos if validation fails

#### Scenario: Existing worktree detection

- **GIVEN** a worktree already exists for the specified branch and repo
- **WHEN** Claude calls `propose_change`
- **THEN** the tool returns success with the ref ID plus existing worktree metadata (status, last activity)
- **AND** Claude can present a `choice` to the user: resume the existing session or start fresh

#### Scenario: Explicit change request via work-mode reaction

- **GIVEN** `changesWorkflow.enabled` is `true` AND `reactions.changesWorkflow.enabled` is `true`
- **WHEN** a dev+ user reacts with the work-mode emoji
- **THEN** the system processes the message through the standard `processMessage` pipeline with `workMode: true`
- **AND** Claude receives a prompt hint to use `propose_change` with `auto: true`
- **AND** the change is auto-executed without a button click

#### Scenario: Work-mode reaction from non-dev user

- **GIVEN** `reactions.changesWorkflow.enabled` is `true`
- **WHEN** a non-dev user reacts with the work-mode emoji
- **THEN** the system processes the message through the standard Q&A flow
- **AND** no change proposal tools are available (per existing role gating)

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Legacy XML-based plan generation

**Reason**: Replaced by the unified `processMessage` flow with MCP tool-based change proposals (`propose_change` + `auto: true`). The XML parsing path (`generateChangePlan`, `PLAN_GENERATION_PROMPT`, `<change-plan>` regex) is removed entirely.

**Migration**: No migration needed — the work-mode reaction emoji now routes through `processMessage` with the same tool pipeline as all other triggers.
