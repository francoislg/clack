## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Send to Thread Action Type

The system SHALL support a `post_to` action type (renamed from `send_to_thread`) that posts specific content to a channel or thread. Each button carries its own content, persisted at creation time.

#### Scenario: post_to action with content

- **WHEN** Claude calls `submit_response` with `{ type: "post_to", content: "<text>" }` and optional `label`
- **THEN** the system persists the `content` as a dedicated entry in session snapshots keyed by a unique ID
- **AND** if `auto` is not `true`, the Slack UI renders a primary-styled button (default label: "Post to thread")
- **AND** the button value encodes the session ID and the content entry ID

#### Scenario: post_to content is required

- **WHEN** Claude calls `submit_response` with a `post_to` action that omits `content`
- **THEN** the tool returns a validation error indicating `content` is required
- **AND** delivery is NOT attempted

#### Scenario: Multiple post_to buttons with different content

- **WHEN** Claude calls `submit_response` with multiple `post_to` actions, each with distinct `content`
- **THEN** each action gets its own persisted content entry with a unique ID
- **AND** clicking any button posts only that button's content, not the full response

#### Scenario: post_to action rendering

- **WHEN** a response includes a `post_to` action without `auto: true`
- **THEN** the button is rendered with action_id `clack_post_to`
- **AND** the button value encodes the session ID and content entry ID

#### Scenario: post_to with auto true is not rendered as button

- **WHEN** a response includes a `post_to` action with `auto: true`
- **THEN** the action is NOT rendered as a button
- **AND** the action is handled by auto-execute after delivery

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility with send_to_thread action ID

- **WHEN** a user clicks a button with the legacy `clack_dm_send_to_thread` action ID
- **THEN** the system handles it identically to `clack_post_to`
